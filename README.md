# EmployeeDatabase

This is an example of a school database made to help schools organize their employees and students. NetBeans was used to create the program. To use the program, download all the files, open them through a Java IDE, and run the file "FrmMainPage.java" located inside the "src" folder. Access the added employees, students, and inventory through their respective .txt files located in the main directory.
